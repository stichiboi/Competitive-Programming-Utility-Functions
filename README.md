# Competitive-Programming-Utility-Functions
Collection of handy functions that I regularly use while exercising on open.kattis.com


# Heyo
Here are a couple of functions I often use.
They include basic stuff (like taking a vector in input, or separating a string delimited with a certain char) all the way to more complex algorithms (e.g. Dijkstra algorithm, but with customizable priority function)

# Please:
Let me know if you feel like I could improve some functions: I would love to learn a trick or two :)

I will keep updating this repo as I write new useful stuff
